    <p> &emsp; &emsp;   24*7 bank we accepts deposits from the public and creates credit.
         Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly 
         through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial 
         stability of a country, we are highly regulated in most countries. 
         Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional 
         reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only 
         a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations 
         intended to ensure liquidity, we are generally subject to minimum 
         capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, 
         known as the Basel Accords. </p>
    <p> &emsp; &emsp;A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide financial services such as wealth management, currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes. There are several different kinds of banks including retail banks, commercial or corporate banks, and investment banks. In most countries, banks are regulated by the national government or central bank.</p>
